### 6502 Emulator Pre-Design Document

1. Project Overview
    - Project Name: 6502 Emulator
    - Objective: Develop a software emulator for the 6502 microprocessor, enabling the execution and testing of 6502 assembly language programs in a simulated environment.

2. Background
    - The 6502 microprocessor is foundational in retro computing, powering devices like the Commodore 64 and the NES. This emulator will allow developers and enthusiasts to understand and experiment with low-level programming.

3. Current Status
    - Codebase: The project is hosted on GitHub: 6502 Emulator Repository.
    - Key Functionalities Implementing:
    
      - Basic CPU instruction execution (instructions like LDA, STA, etc.).
      
      - Memory management (with implemented classes for memory handling).
      
      - Initial structure for loading and executing assembly programs.

4. Requirements

     - Functional Requirements

        - Support a subset of the 6502 instruction set (like LDA).
    
        - Ability to load and execute 6502 assembly programs.
    
        - Implement memory management for simulated RAM (work in progress).
      
        - Basic I/O management (to be defined as the project progresses).

    - Non-Functional Requirements:

        - Performance: Aim for efficient execution to closely match real-time behavior.
  
        - Portability: Ensure compatibility across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  
        - Usability: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) that is intuitive for users.
          
5. Scope
    - In-Scope:
     
      - Implementing core CPU functionalities based on the current code structure.
      
      - Creating a CLI for program loading and execution.
    
      - Adding debugging features, such as step-by-step execution and state visualization.
     

    - Out-of-Scope:
      
      - GUI development and complex peripheral emulation will not be included in the initial scope.
        
6. Architecture
   
    - High-Level Design:
      - Components:
        - CPU Emulator: Responsible for instruction fetching, decoding, and execution. (This could be represented by a class in your code.)
        - Memory Management: Handles memory read/write operations.
        - I/O Module: Will manage input and output operations, which could be enhanced later.
      - Data Flow:
        - Users load programs via the CLI.
        - The CPU emulator processes instructions fetched from memory.
        - Outputs are displayed through the CLI, allowing users to see execution results and debug information.
       

7. Technologies
    - Programming Language: C++ 
    - Development Environment: Visual Studio Code 
    - Libraries/Frameworks: google test

8. Timeline

    - Milestones:
      - Complete core CPU operation implementation.
      - Finalize memory management features.
      - Conduct testing and debugging of core functionalities.

9. Risks and Challenges

    - Technical Complexity: The 6502 architecture is very intricate and may pose challenges.
    - Testing: Ensuring accurate emulation of all instructions will require comprehensive testing against known 6502 benchmarks.

10. Future Enhancements
    - Potential future features could include:
    - Developing a GUI for enhanced user interaction.
    - Supporting additional I/O devices and peripherals.
    - Integrating modern assembly development tools for program input.
